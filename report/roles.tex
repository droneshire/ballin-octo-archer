\subsection{Albert Ou}

Albert was responsible for developing the collision detection algorithm.
In particular, he contributed the idea of conflict zones, defined the
intersection geometry, and formalized the path equations.
He also typeset the majority of the presentation slides.

\subsection{Praagya Singh}

Praagya was responsible for initial work in defining the intersection
geometry, including the path equations and the constraints on buffer
distances.  He was also responsible for designing and modeling the
controller.  He created the Ptolemy model for the controller that allowed it
to communicate with only a single vehicle of the MultiInstanceCompositeActor.

\subsection{Ross Yeager}

Ross, along with all members, helped define the overall system problem and assumpions, and he was specifically in charge of designing and modelling the entire vehicle model.  
He created the Ptolemy system consisting of Multi-Instance Composite actors that allowed for a scalabile system with respect to the number of cars in the intersection.  
He created a the system that allowed for continous vehicle flow as well as the FSM that defined vehicle behavior.
