%\subsection{Course Application}
In order to analyze and simulate our model, Ptolemy modelling software was used.  This tool allows for the creation of hybrid systems such as those seen in the autonomous roadway.  We used Modal Models for the vehicles represented in the system, and had to implement non-zero delay feedback loops in order to prevent a zeno system (both subject examined in class).  Furthermore, we simulated the basics of any standard system: a controller and environment of which it controls.
